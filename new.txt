# 🧭 Python Learning Objectives — Post-MOOC2024 Roadmap

## 1. Core Reinforcement & Good Practices
- Review key MOOC2024 concepts: functions, classes, file handling, and modules.
- Write cleaner, more reusable code using docstrings and modular design.
- Practice debugging with `pdb`, `traceback`, and custom error handling.
- Learn virtual environments (`venv`) and requirements management (`pip freeze`).

---

## 2. Python Automation & Scripting
- Automate routine computer tasks (file renaming, backups, folder organization).
- Work with the OS using `os`, `shutil`, `pathlib`, and `subprocess`.
- Automate Excel, CSV, or text reports using `openpyxl` and `pandas`.
- Schedule and run jobs automatically (Task Scheduler / cron).
- Securely store and use environment variables (`os.getenv`, `.env` files).

---

## 3. APIs & Web Integration
- Understand **HTTP basics** (methods, headers, and status codes).
- Use the `requests` library to interact with public APIs.
- Parse and handle JSON data in API responses.
- Authenticate with tokens or API keys (GitHub, OpenWeather, etc.).
- Handle pagination, rate limits, and error responses.
- Build your own small REST API with **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
- Connect APIs together (e.g., fetch data from one API and send to another).

---

## 4. Data Handling & Small Utilities
- Save API data into CSV, JSON, or SQLite databases.
- Automate data cleanup and transformation using `pandas`.
- Build command-line tools with `argparse` or `click`.
- Add logging, timestamps, and config files to scripts.
- Create simple dashboards or summaries from fetched data.

---

## 5. DevOps & Cloud Automation
- Learn **Docker** basics: build, run, and automate container tasks.
- Write Python scripts to manage containers using the Docker SDK.
- Interact with cloud APIs (AWS, Azure, or GCP) for automation tasks.
- Automate Git operations using Python and the GitHub API.
- Explore **CI/CD automation** (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.).
- Use `paramiko` or `fabric` for remote server scripting (SSH automation).
- Read logs, monitor processes, and generate system reports automatically.

---

## 6. Advanced Topics (Optional / Long-Term)
- Learn **async programming** for handling multiple API calls efficiently.
- Explore **web scraping** with `BeautifulSoup` or `Playwright`.
- Build a **simple REST client tool** or API monitor.
- Understand **design patterns** for scalable automation.
- Learn basic **unit testing** and **pytest** for script reliability.
- Explore packaging your projects (`setup.py`, PyPI publishing).

---

## 7. Portfolio & Projects
- Create an **Automation Portfolio** repository:
  - File organizer or system cleanup tool.
  - Weather or crypto price tracker using APIs.
  - GitHub repo monitor or auto-notifier.
  - Docker container monitor or deployment script.
  - Flask/FastAPI microservice connected to a public API.
- Document projects with `README.md` and setup instructions.

---

💡 **End Goal:**  
By completing this roadmap, you’ll transition from a Python fundamentals learner to a **developer capable of automating workflows, integrating APIs, and writing DevOps-ready scripts**.
