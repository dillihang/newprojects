# 🧭 Python Learning Objectives — Post-MOOC2024 Roadmap


From now on, every exercise will include:

1. Concept overview
Plain-language explanation of the idea, not the code.

2. Micro-examples
Tiny, minimal examples to show the pattern in isolation.

3. Gotchas / pitfalls
Where people usually lock themselves into verbose / rigid designs.

4. Your exercise
With constraints that force you to think in systems, not scripts.

This is now part of how I’ll teach you. 👍

A mental model to keep forever (save this)

When you’re designing automation, always ask:

“Am I writing instructions, or am I building an executor?”

If you’re repeating:

connect

run command

check result

print

stop or continue

👉 You probably want an executor, not another helper function

When teaching or reviewing my code:
- Prefer abstraction over repetition
- Show me execution patterns (generic runners, action pipelines, handlers)
- Explain the *thinking shift*, not just the refactor
- Keep solutions simple but scalable
- Use the structure:
  1. Concept overview
  2. Micro-examples
  3. Gotchas
  4. Exercise
