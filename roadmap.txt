# 🧭 Python Learning Objectives — Post-MOOC2024 Roadmap


Absolutely — that makes perfect sense, and it’s the right way to learn APIs (or any new module).
From Stage 3 onward, I’ll always give you:

✅ 1. Concept overview

A short explanation of the new topic in simple language.

✅ 2. Micro-examples

Tiny, minimal examples that show how things work before you do the exercise.

✅ 3. Gotchas / pitfalls

Common mistakes beginners make.

✅ 4. Your exercise

Clear instructions + constraints so you learn the right skills.

stages 

## 1. Core Reinforcement & Good Practices ✅

---

## 6. Advanced Topics (Optional / Long-Term)
- Learn **async programming** for handling multiple API calls efficiently.
- Explore **web scraping** with `BeautifulSoup` or `Playwright`.
- Build a **simple REST client tool** or API monitor.
- Understand **design patterns** for scalable automation.
- Learn basic **unit testing** and **pytest** for script reliability.
- Explore packaging your projects (`setup.py`, PyPI publishing).

---

## 7. Portfolio & Projects
- Create an **Automation Portfolio** repository:
  - File organizer or system cleanup tool.
  - Weather or crypto price tracker using APIs.
  - GitHub repo monitor or auto-notifier.
  - Docker container monitor or deployment script.
  - Flask/FastAPI microservice connected to a public API.
- Document projects with `README.md` and setup instructions.

---

💡 **End Goal:**  
By completing this roadmap, you’ll transition from a Python fundamentals learner to a **developer capable of automating workflows, integrating APIs, and writing DevOps-ready scripts**.

Stage 2: Python Automation & Scripting — Exercise Roadmap 
1. File & Folder Automation✅

Exercise 1: Rename all .txt files in a folder to add a timestamp suffix.

Exercise 2: Move all files of a certain type (e.g., .jpg) into a subfolder called Images.

Exercise 3: Delete empty folders in a given directory recursively.

2. System & OS Interaction✅

Exercise 4: Write a script to list all running processes (hint: subprocess or psutil).

Exercise 5: Create a backup script: copy a folder and all its contents to a backup location.

Exercise 6: Get system info (OS name, CPU, RAM, disk space) and save to a log file.

3. Data Automation✅

Exercise 7: Read a CSV, filter rows based on a condition, save to a new CSV.

Exercise 8: Read an Excel file, summarize numeric columns (sum, average), and write a new Excel report.

Exercise 9: Automate text report generation: combine multiple .txt files into one, with headers.

4. Scheduling & Automation✅

Exercise 10: Write a script that logs a message to a file every minute (for practice; use time.sleep).

Exercise 11: Modify one of your earlier scripts to run automatically using cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows).

Exercise 12: Use environment variables to store configuration, e.g., paths or API keys.

5. CLI Tools✅

Exercise 13: Build a CLI tool to move files of a certain type (argparse)

Exercise 14: Build a CLI tool to summarize a folder’s contents (file counts, sizes).

Exercise 15: Add logging to your CLI tools (timestamped actions, errors).

- Create `/items` endpoint → returns a list of items
- Create `/items/<id>` endpoint → returns a specific item by ID
- Handle proper HTTP status codes (200, 404, 400, etc.)
- Optionally: allow creating (`POST`) and deleting (`DELETE`) items

- Send the processed data to API B (your own API from Exercise 21/22)
- Ensure proper error handling and logging

## 6. Optional Bonus Projects (Not Required)
------------------------------------------------
Bonus A — Web Scraper + API Hybrid
