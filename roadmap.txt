# 🧭 Python Learning Objectives — Post-MOOC2024 Roadmap


Absolutely — that makes perfect sense, and it’s the right way to learn APIs (or any new module).
From Stage 3 onward, I’ll always give you:

✅ 1. Concept overview

A short explanation of the new topic in simple language.

✅ 2. Micro-examples

Tiny, minimal examples that show how things work before you do the exercise.

✅ 3. Gotchas / pitfalls

Common mistakes beginners make.

✅ 4. Your exercise

Clear instructions + constraints so you learn the right skills.
